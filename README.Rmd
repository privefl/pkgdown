pkgdown is designed to make it quick and easy to build a website for your package. You can see pkgdown in action at <http://pkgdown.r-lib.org>: this is the output of pkgdown applied to the latest version of pkgdown. Learn more in `vignette("pkgdown")` or `?build_site`.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("pkgdown")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("r-lib/pkgdown")
```

## Usage

Run pkgdown from the package directory each time you release your package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This will generate a `docs/` directory. The home page will be generated from your package's `README.md`, and a function reference will be generated from the documentation in the `man/` directory. If you are using GitHub, the easiest way to make this your package website is to check into git, then go settings for your repo and make sure that the __GitHub pages__ source is set to "master branch /docs folder".

The package also includes an RStudio add-in which you can bind to a keyboard shortcut. I recommend `Cmd + Shift + W`: it uses Cmd + Shift, like all other package development worksheets, it replaces a rarely used command (close all tabs), and the W is mnemonic for website.

To customise your site, create `_pkgdown.yml` and modify it as described in the documentation. Alternatively, you can also use `pkgdown/_pkgdown.yml` if you need other files to customise your site.

## In the wild

As at last count, pkgdown is used [by over 1600 packages](https://github.com/search?q=pkgdown.css+in%3Apath+path%3Adocs&type=Code). 

Here are a few examples created by people contributors to pkgdown:

* [bayesplot](http://mc-stan.org/bayesplot/index.html)
  [[source](https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/tree/gh-pages)]:
  plotting functions for posterior analysis, model checking, and MCMC 
  diagnostics.

* [valr](https://rnabioco.github.io/valr/) 
  [[source](https://github.com/rnabioco/valr)]: 
  read and manipulate genome intervals and signals.

* [mkin](http://jranke.github.io/mkin/)
  [[source](https://github.com/jranke/mkin)]:
  calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report

* [NMF](http://renozao.github.io/NMF/master/index.html)
  [[source](https://github.com/renozao/NMF)]:
  a framework to perform non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).

Comparing the output with the source is a great way to learn new pkgdown techniques (particularly because ironically, the pkgdown documentation isn't very good yet)
